Thank you for downloading the SWTOR File Changer! This tool allows you
to edit the asset files of the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic.
You can choose which files you want to replace and customize the game
as you wish.

Please note that this tool is provided under no warranty. You are free
to use this program at your own risk. Editing the asset files can cause
your game to crash or show graphical glitches. When a new patch can be
downloaded, be prepared to restore your game files to the original
version BEFORE you download the patch, otherwise your game may be broken
and you need to redownload it.

If you want to use the automatic backup feature, make sure that you have
at least 5 GB of free memory on your hard drive. Remember that you can
also store this tool on a different hard drive that has more free memory.

!!Note that the tool needs to be restarted whenever you make a change
to the settings.txt file.!!



== How to use the tool ==

Before starting, this tool will only work if you are using the Non-Bitraider version of the client.
If you are using Bitraider then you will need to remove and unistall it. 
This will result in a complete reinstallation of the game.

Once that is done and you are ready, follow these steps:


1.Set the director to the location of your SWTOR files:

In most cases:

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\Bioware\Star Wars - The Old Republic"



2.Make sure "Live" is selected and not pts.



3.Make sure "create backup" is checked. This will auto-create backup files of your assets so
you can restore them at any time.



4. Once all is ready, click "Start Changing Files".
This process can take a minute or two depending on your CPU speed.
Please wait for it to finish, it may look like it is frozen at times but it is working.



----VERY IMPORTANT----

As stated before please remember to restore your backup assets 
before downloading a new patch when one releases.
